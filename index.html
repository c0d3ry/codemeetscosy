        There’s something undeniably magical about getting lost in a good book;
        the gentle rustle of turning pages, the comforting weight of a story in
        your hands, and the way words have a power to wrap around your heart
        like a favourite sweater. Being a bookworm is mainly about slipping
        between the lines of everyday life to explore distant worlds, hidden
        truths, and moments that linger long after the final chapter.
        <br />

        In a world that moves too fast, books offer a cosy pause - a place to
        breathe, dream, and feel deeply. Whether it’s a rainy afternoon curled
        up by the window or a few stolen minutes before bed, the simple joy of
        reading invites you home to yourself. So here’s to dog-eared pages,
        late-night chapters, and the beautiful comfort of being a bookworm.
